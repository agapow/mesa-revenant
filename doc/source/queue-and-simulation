The Queue and Simulations
=========================

Why batch?
----------

MeSA provides the queue as a way a way of batching analyses and manipulations of trees together, to be run as a single unit. This is to two ends, replication and simulation:

**Replication:** often you want to assess a metric or result across a group of trees or the ditribution of possible effects on a single tree. For example: 

* A researcher may wish to know metrics differ across a set of trees, such as looking at imbalance statistics across a set of mammalian phylogenies.

* Given a tree with uncertain topology, represented by a set of possible trees output by a program like MrBayes, metrics can allow for this uncertainty by calculating over all trees and using the resultant distribution to calculate confidence limits.

* The expected effect of a manipulation - such as a random mass extinction - may need to be quantified by repeating that manipulation multiple times on the same tree, taking measurements after each change and then restoring the tree to its original state.

**Simulation:** much of evolutionary research is based on forensic approaches - dissecting available "real" phylogenies for evidence of evolutionary events or modes. This "paleontological" approach can be thwarted by a lack of useful phylogenies, ignorance about what happened deep in the phylogenies history and reconstruction biases. An alternative approach is study evolutionary events in an emergent or synthetic way. That is, recreate the phylogenies that result under particular scenarios and compare these to realworld phylogenies:

* Do "real" phylogenies have the same characteristics as simulated ones? If so, they may have evolved under similar scenarios.
