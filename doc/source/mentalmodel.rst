Overview and concepts
=====================

To explain MeSA and give a better idea of how it works, here I'll sketch out a
"mile-high" picture of what it does and how it does it.

MeSA loads, generates and manipulates three types of data:

* Phylogenetic trees: trees and the taxa (often species) that are within
  and at the tips of these trees. If multiple trees are loaded, at any time one
  is designated as the "active tree", upon which analysis takes place

* Discrete trait data: categorical data that is associated with taxa on the
  tree(s) 
  
* Continuous trait data: real (floating point) data that is associated with taxa
  on the tree(s)
