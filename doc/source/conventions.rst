Conventions
===========

Throughout this manual, where examples of a system commandline or prompt are given, these will be written in monospaced typeface as follows::

	% ps -aux | grep python

Prompts within a commandline-driven program like MeSA will similarly be written::

	mesa> 

A series of menu or subcommand choices will be written in italics, with the steps seperated by slashes:

	*Open file / File type / Discrete*
