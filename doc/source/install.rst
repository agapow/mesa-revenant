Installation
============

Compilation
-----------

MeSA should compile on most Unix-like systems, including Mac OSX, as follows::

   % cd src
   % make

An executable called ``mesa`` will now appear in that directory. You can move
and install it as you wish.


Potential problems
------------------

* Some (many?) warning messages may be generated by the make process. This is
  due largely to more recent C++ compilers being stricter about what they
  accept. They can be ignored and should not cause any problems within MeSA.

* We assume that compiler you use is g++. Edit the Makefile if necessary.
  Ditto for compiler flags.
