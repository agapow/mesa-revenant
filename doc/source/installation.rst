Installation
============

Platforms
---------

MeSA is a commandline program. It is primarily intended for use in Unix and Unix-like environments (including MacOS), and thus is distributed as a tarball or source code. However, it is possible to compile and run it on other platforms, e.g. by using a POSIX-compatiable environment like Cygwin under Windows.


Obtaining MeSA
--------------

The source code can be downloaded from:

	<http://www.agapow.net/software/mesa>__

Alternatively, it can be cloned from the development repository on Github::

	% git clone git://github.com/agapow/mesa-revenant.git

.. note::
	
	In some cases, Git may insist that you be identified to clone a remote repository and create a local one. In this case create ``.gitconfig`` in your home directory and populate with your name and email address::

		[user]
			name = Paul-Michael Agapow
			email = pma@agapow.net


Compilation
-----------

MeSA should compile on most Unix-like systems. First unpack the tarball, and then from the top level of the unpacked distribution::

   % make

An executable called ``mesa`` will now appear in the ``src`` directory. You can move and install it as you wish, or type the following to have it installed in ``/usr/local/bin`` (this may require superuser privileges)::

	% make install


Potential problems
------------------

* Some (many?) warning messages may be generated by the make process. This is due largely to more recent C++ compilers being stricter about what they accept. They can be ignored and should not cause any problems within MeSA.

* We assume that compiler you use is gcc. Edit the Makefile if necessary. Ditto for compiler flags.
