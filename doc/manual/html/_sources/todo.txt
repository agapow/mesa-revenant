To do
=====

Possible changes and fixes:

* Improve Makefile for better builds across platforms

* Check Prune functions, which don't look like they actually work

* Add to documentation, including recipes and examples

* Better editting of analysis queue

* Embedded scripting and so forth

* Embedded instructions / executions in Nexus files

* Really, this should all be ported to Python ...
