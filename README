MeSA - macroevolutionary simulation and analysis
================================================

MeSA is a program for exploring phylogenies and deep evolutionary history. To
this end it offers tools and functions for:

* analysing the shape and other metrics of trees
* simulating ("growing") trees under complex evolutionary scenarios
* pruning or otherwise manipulating trees to simulate the results of extinction
  or conservation schemes 
* repetition and pipelining of the above functions over a population of trees,
  or over the same tree repeatedly, for statistical purposes 


Caveats
~~~~~~~

* Documentation is still an ongoing work.
* Having been recently ported from an old architecture, some bugs may have been
  introduced.
* MeSA is currently distributed only as source code that requires compiling on
  a Unix-like system (including OSX).
* Interacting and using the analysis queue is admittedly awkward on the
  commandline.

(written by Rich Hickey) and the Nexus Class Library (written by Paul Lewis).
